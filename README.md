## 🚀 About Me

I am a Master's student in Data Analytics Engineering at Northeastern University with a strong focus on machine learning, deep learning, and MLOps. I enjoy building end-to-end AI systems, from data processing and modeling to deployment and monitoring.

I have hands-on experience working on real-world projects involving NLP, predictive modeling, cloud-based ML pipelines, and scalable AI solutions. My long-term goal is to work as a Data Scientist or ML Engineer on impactful, production-grade systems.
